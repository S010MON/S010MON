### About Me

I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student. Currently on summer break working on personal projects to improve my Python skills looking at ballistics modeling and visualisation.  I'm keen to build a 'Everything From NAND' simulator that will allow a user to build circuits from NAND gates and show how abstraction works from the circuit level up, we shall see how that progresses!

### Tutoring
